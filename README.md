# NASM-libraries
Hello everyone. These are libraries that I have made while I was learning NASM assembly so that I could get some work done quicker. Using this library makes it easier to code in assembly, and I plan to continue updating it as I learn more and more about NASM assembly.

## Usage
Using the library is quite simple. I have tried to document as much as possible about this library. There is a lib_structure.txt file, and this file will list out every file in the library, all the functions in each file, all of the function parameters, and how it outputs values. In order to use this library, all you have to do is type "%include 'filename'" at the top of your .asm file, and then type "call [function name]" in your .txt section whenever you want to call a function in your code :)

I also realize that there is one random python file in this project. That file is only used for assembling your code, and nothing more than that. You can easily run that script using "python assemble.py [enter_your_asm_file_here]".
